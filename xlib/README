xlib programming example programs.
---------------------------------

This directory contains the source code for several example programs,
as well as the xlib programming tutorial. See the tutorial for explanations
about what the various programs here do.

To compile the programs, type 'make' (or 'gmake', to use gnu make).
To remove all the compiler-generated files, type 'make clean'
(or 'gmake clean').
